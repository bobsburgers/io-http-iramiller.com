<h1 id="notice-of-email-pgp-key-change">Notice of Email &amp; PGP Key Change</h1>
<p>I am consolidating and organizing all communication into one public and one private channel. From today forward, please contact me at <a href="public@iramiller.com">public@iramiller.com</a>, using key <code>20F44729</code>. I created one other address with the <code>iramiller.com</code> domain for my private use, but this will use the same <code>20F44729</code> key.</p>
<ul>
<li>public@iramiller.com</li>
<li><a href="keydir/isysd.asc">20F44729</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deprecated-addresses">Deprecated Addresses</h3>
<p>The following domains and corresponding email addresses are being phased out. Emails going to these addresses will be forwarded.</p>
<ul>
<li>deginner.com</li>
<li>gitguild.com</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, I am no longer using the following addresses, though the domains remain active. Emails going here may be forwarded, and will be answered slowly.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://coinapult.com">coinapult.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://fi.co">founderinstitute.net</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gmail.com">gmail.com</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deprecated-keys">Deprecated Keys</h3>
<p>Finally, the following PGP keys are deprecated. I will never use any of them again to sign or encrypt communication. If you receive a message signed or encrypted with one of these keys, treat it as if you did not know it was from me.</p>
<ul>
<li>9DAD2C03</li>
<li>6CD2F41F</li>
<li>638DA742</li>
<li>B5D3D208</li>
<li>4E4FBA61</li>
<li>5C3586F6</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="signatures">Signatures</h3>
<p>The only valid key for the next ~3 years, or until I post another Notice of Change, will be <code>20F44729</code>. You can find the full ascii-armored key <a href="keydir/isysd.asc">here</a>. The source code for this notice (<a href="src/KeyChange.md">KeyChange.md</a>) was signed with <a href="signatures/KeyChange.md.20F44729.asc">20F44729</a>, as well as <a href="signatures/KeyChange.md.5C3586F6.asc">5C3586F6</a>, and <a href="signatures/KeyChange.md.6CD2F41F.asc">6CD2F41F</a>.</p>
