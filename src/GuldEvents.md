# Guld Events Schedule

Starting next Wednesday May 17th, I will host a weekly event on a [guld](https://guld.io)-related topic. Whenever possible, these events will be a concerted effort with other groups like [PanaFintech](http://www.panafintech.com/), [PanamaJS Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/panamajs/), and [Panama Bitcoin meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Panama-Bitcoin/). Since guld is fintech, cryptocurrency, and JS, sometimes there will be constructive overlap.

Though I or some other guld member will be prepared to present a topic each week, coordination and cross promotion are very important. We're open to suggestions to change agenda, location, or time of any week's event.

### When

Every Wed. at 7pm unless otherwise specified.

### Where

Restaurante El Charro Mexicano
Calle 74
San Francisco, Panama City, Panama

### Format

| Begin | End | Agenda |
|-------|-----|--------|
| 7:00 | 7:15 | Intro (w/ language vote) |
| 7:15 | 7:45 | Presentation(s) |
| 8:00 | 9:00 | Networking |

If Ira or another sufficiently bilingual person is presenting, the Intro will include a show of hands vote on the presentation language. The intro and presentation will be webcast to [Youtube](https://youtube.com), unless the presenter opts out.

Launch events will have different location and format.

### Organization

For now coordination for future events should be done through Google calendar, and organized by team. The following calendars have already been created, and shared with core team members. If you do want access to another calendar on this list, please tell me.
